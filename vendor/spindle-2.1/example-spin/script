# Each of the following parts consists of a Koala picture.

# We extract the different parts of the file (bitmap, video matrix and colour
# RAM) and load them directly to their respective target addresses. The "!"
# indicates that this part should be written directly into I/O space, and hence
# colour RAM. Without the exclamation mark, the data would go into shadow RAM. 

# Admittedly, it is a bit silly to also load the background colour in this way.
